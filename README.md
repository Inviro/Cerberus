# Cerberus
Cerberus is an implementation of Google's AutoML Vision API. We trained the model to analyze security footage(or still images) and detect aggressive or threatening behaviors. The training model that we put together detects such threats and then sends out an alert message to authorities or relevant people through Twilio.

We as a team hope to create something that will help keep people safe in the event of violent crimes using the emerging technologies of deep learning.
