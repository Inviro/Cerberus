# Cerberus
Cerberus is an implementation of Google's AutoML Vision API. We trained the model to analyze security footage(or any recordings) and detect agressive or threatening behavior. The training model we put together can detect these threats and through Twilio, we can send out an alert message to authorities or any other qualified person.
